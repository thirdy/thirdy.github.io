3. Path of Exile Open Source Projects:
  - [ExileTrade](http://exiletra.de/) - A Search website specialized in finding items for trade. It features search by terms instead of a search form similar to a search engine powered by ElasticSearch. This is a collaborative project where I worked on the JavaScript parts.

  - [Durian](http://thirdy.github.io/durian/) - Predecessor to ExileTrade, it features the same concept of search by terms but as a Java Swing Desktop Application. This tool acts as a layer on top of popular search site called poe.trade. It works by emulating HTTP requests to poe.trade and web scraping it’s html respone. The tool was popular for it’s automated search feature.
